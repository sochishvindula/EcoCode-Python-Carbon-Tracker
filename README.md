**Measure your Python code's environmental impact in real-time!**

EcoCode helps you write more sustainable code by tracking energy consumption, calculating CO2 emissions, and suggesting optimizations. Perfect for climate-conscious developers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This

As a robotics engineer in Berlin, I noticed we optimize code for speed and memory, but never for environmental impact. EcoCode bridges this gap by making sustainability measurable.
