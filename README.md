**Measure your Python code's environmental impact in real-time!**

EcoCode helps you write more sustainable code by tracking energy consumption, calculating CO2 emissions, and suggesting optimizations. Perfect for climate-conscious developers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This

As a robotics engineer in Berlin, I noticed we optimize code for speed and memory, but never for environmental impact. EcoCode bridges this gap by making sustainability measurable.

## âš¡ Quick Start

from ecocode import eco_monitor

@eco_monitor
def your_function():
# Your code here
return "Hello, green world!"

your_function()


## ðŸ“Š What You Get

- **Real-time energy monitoring** during code execution
- **CO2 emissions calculation** based on regional grid
- **Tree-hours needed** to offset your code's impact
- **Easy decorator** for any function

## ðŸ”§ Installation

pip install psutil
python ecocode.py

pip install psutil
python ecocode.py
